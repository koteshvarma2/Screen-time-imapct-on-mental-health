Digital Wellness Dashboard for monitoring and analyzing screen.

The modern world, digital devices have become an integral part of everyday life, offering unparalleled 
convenience, connectivity, and productivity. However, the widespread use of smartphones, laptops, and tablets has 
also given rise to concerns about excessive screen time and its impact on mental and physical well-being. Prolonged 
screen exposure is often linked to disrupted sleep patterns, reduced focus, increased stress levels, and a general 
decline in overall health. With digital workflows blending seamlessly into personal and professional spaces, 
understanding and managing one’s screen time is essential for fostering a balanced lifestyle.Screen time tracking 
dashboards have emerged as powerful tools that help individuals and organizations gain clarity about their digital 
habits. These platforms provide real-time monitoring of device usage across categories such as social media, 
entertainment, and productivity applications. By logging active usage time and differentiating it from idle periods, 
these dashboards offer detailed insights into how digital engagement affects daily routines and productivity. Beyond 
simple statistics, modern screen time dashboards incorporate intelligent analytics and personalized 
recommendations to help users optimize their usage patterns, reduce distractions, and enhance focus.The benefits 
of using a screen time dashboard extend far beyond mere awareness. They empower users to identify the apps and 
websites consuming disproportionate amounts of their time and encourage healthier boundaries between work and 
leisure. For remote teams and organizations, these dashboards foster transparency and accountability without 
intrusive micromanagement, contributing to a more efficient and trust-based work culture. Additionally, features 
such as categorized tracking, idle time detection, and comprehensive reporting help users make informed decisions 
and set achievable goals for digital wellness.This project presents an AI-powered screen time dashboard designed 
to analyze real-time user data across multiple dimensions. It categorizes activities into social media, 
work/productivity, entertainment, and focus, among others, and delivers actionable insights tailored to individual 
patterns. The dashboard’s clean, interactive interface visualizes screen time distribution and provides personalized 
advice to improve sleep quality, enhance concentration, and maintain balanced digital habits. By bridging data 
analysis with user-centric recommendations, this tool aims to support healthier digital lifestyles and boost both 
personal well-being and productivity in an increasingly digital world.
